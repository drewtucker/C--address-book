#### Program that allows users to enter and save Contacts to a list. 2/9/2018

#### By **Drew Tucker**

## Description

A website that allows users to enter a Contact with relevant information, including their name, phone number, and address. The address is stored as a separate object that includes a street, city, state, and zip code. The program takes the data entered by the user and adds it to a static list that is then displayed to the user. The user is then given the option of adding another Contact to the list, or deleting all the Contacts in the list. This site was practice in building MVC web apps using Razor and C#.


### Specs

1. Program prompts user to add a Contact. This will take the user to the page containing a form for Contact entry.

2. Once user has entered all Contact information and clicked "Add Contact", the Contact is then added to the list, and the user is taken to the page displaying the list of all added contacts so far.

3. The user is then given the option of either adding another Contact, or clearing all Contacts in the list.

4. If the user clicks "Clear All Contacts", the current Contact list will be deleted, and the user will be taken to a page that displays a message saying they have been deleted. They are then given the option to go back to the index page.
